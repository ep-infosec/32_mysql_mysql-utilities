Test case 1 - elect with discovery and socket
# Discovering slaves for master at localhost:PORT1
# Discovering slave at localhost:PORT2
# Found slave: localhost:PORT2
# Discovering slave at localhost:PORT3
# Found slave: localhost:PORT3
# Discovering slave at localhost:PORT4
# Found slave: localhost:PORT4
# Checking privileges.
# Checking privileges on candidates.
# Electing candidate slave from candidate list then slaves list.
# Best slave found is located on localhost:PORT2.
# ...done.
Test case 2 - failover with discovery and socket
# Checking privileges.
# Checking privileges on candidates.
# Performing failover.
# Candidate slave localhost:PORT2 will become the new master.
# Checking slaves status (before failover).
# Preparing candidate for failover.
# Creating replication user if it does not exist.
# Stopping slaves.
# Performing STOP on all slaves.
# Switching slaves to new master.
# Disconnecting new master as slave.
# Starting slaves.
# Performing START on all slaves.
# Checking slaves for errors.
# Failover complete.
