  --ssl-cert=SSL_CERT   name of the SSL certificate file to use for
                        establishing a secure connection.
  --ssl-key=SSL_KEY     name of the SSL key file to use for establishing a
                        secure connection.
  --ssl=SSL             specifies if the server connection requires use of
                        SSL. If an encrypted connection cannot be established,
                        the connection attempt fails. By default 0 (SSL not
                        required).

                        it will print the unused binary log files.
  --binlog=BINLOG       Binlog file name to keep (not to purge). All the
                        binary log files prior to the specified file will be
                        removed.

                        at startup, query master for all registered slaves and
                        use the user name and password specified to connect.
                        Supply the user and password in the form
                        <user>[:<password>] or <login-path>. For example,
                        --discover-slaves-login=joe:secret will use 'joe' as
                        the user and 'secret' as the password for each
                        discovered slave.
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:

                        separated list.
  -v, --verbose         control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                        verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug

Introduction
------------
The mysqlbinlogpurge utility was designed to purge binary log files in a
replication scenario operating in a safe manner by prohibiting deletion of
binary log files that are open or which are required by a slave (have not
been read by the slave). The utility verifies the latest binary log file that
has been read by all the slave servers to determine the binary log files that
can be deleted.

Note: In order to determine the latest binary log file that has been
replicated by all the slaves, they must be connected to the master at the time
the utility is executed.

The following are examples of use:
  # Purge all the binary log files prior to a specified file for a standalone
  # server.
  $ mysqlbinlogpurge --server=root:pass@host1:3306 \
                     --binlog=bin-log.001302

  # Display the latest binary log that has been replicated by all specified
  # slaves in a replication scenario.
  $ mysqlbinlogpurge --master=root:pass@host2:3306 \
                     --slaves=root:pass@host3:3308,root:pass@host3:3309 \
                     --dry-run
