Test case 5 - show topology - help
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --help                display a help message and exit
  --license             display program's license and exit
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                        path>[<[group]>].
  -l, --show-list       print a list of the topology.
  -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                        display the list in either grid (default), tab, csv,
                        or vertical format
  -r, --recurse         traverse the list of slaves to find additional
                        master/slave connections. User this option to map a
                        replication topology.
  --max-depth=MAX_DEPTH
                        limit the traversal to this depth. Valid only with the
                        --recurse option. Valid values are non-negative
                        integers.
  -p, --prompt          prompt for slave user and password if different from
                        master login.
  -n NUM_RETRIES, --num-retries=NUM_RETRIES
                        number of retries allowed for failed slave login
                        attempt. Valid with --prompt only.
  --ssl-ca=SSL_CA       path to a file that contains a list of trusted SSL
                        CAs.
  --ssl-cert=SSL_CERT   name of the SSL certificate file to use for
                        establishing a secure connection.
  --ssl-key=SSL_KEY     name of the SSL key file to use for establishing a
                        secure connection.
  --ssl=SSL             specifies if the server connection requires use of
                        SSL. If an encrypted connection cannot be established,
                        the connection attempt fails. By default 0 (SSL not
                        required).
  -v, --verbose         control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                        verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug
  -q, --quiet           turn off all messages for quiet execution.
  --discover-slaves-login=DISCOVER
                        at startup, query master for all registered slaves and
                        use the user name and password specified to connect.
                        Supply the user and password in the form
                        <user>[:<password>] or <login-path>. For example,
                        --discover-slaves-login=joe:secret will use 'joe' as
                        the user and 'secret' as the password for each
                        discovered slave.
